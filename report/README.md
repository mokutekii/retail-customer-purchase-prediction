# Report (NeurIPS-style) — Skeleton

This folder contains a minimal LaTeX stub (`report.tex`). To use the official NeurIPS 2023 style:

1) Download the NeurIPS style files (neurips_2023.sty, neurips_2023.tex sample, etc.) from the conference website.
2) Place `neurips_2023.sty` in this `report/` folder.
3) Compile with: `pdflatex report.tex` (run twice), or use Overleaf.

Sections are stubbed to align with course requirements (Abstract, Introduction, Background, Data, Methods, Experiments, Conclusion).
